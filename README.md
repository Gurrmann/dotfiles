## BE AWARE

**The install.sh script is made primarily for fresh installs!**

All old config files will be moved to the map oldConfigs located at ~/.config.

I would instead recommend to take the parts you like from the files and copy paste them in to your own.

however if you do want to run it or just one of the scripts in scripts/
make sure the directory has the path ~/dotfiles
